To do list:
1. Implement 60 fps refresh frequency.
1.1. recalculate movement speed. Dots should not move too fast.
2. Implement impact of evolution factor for each new iteration.
3. Add inheritance mechanic for dots who reach the edge of the map.
4. Make all frame variables automatically connected to the general window size.
5. Implement different types of dots:
- (Standard) Dots - can only move, nothing else.
- Predators - can eat another dots to restore their lifeTime.
- Scavengers - can eat dead bodies to restore their lifeTime.
5.1. Different parameters for each type.
5.2. different colour for each type.
6. Dots leave dead body after their lifeTime variable reach 0.
6.1. Dead body disappears after a while.
7. Add collision check Dot <> Dot. Dots cannot move to occupied positions.
8. Add collision check Predator <> other Dots to eat (except Predators).
9. Add collision check Scavengers <> Dead body to eat.
10. The lifeTime variable should has a small random factor to diversify life cycles.
10.1. Different types of dots has different lifeTime.
11. Add visual edges of the WorkField.

Bugs:
1. MainWindow has wrong bottom-right coordinate which cause a problem that WorkField protrudes over the edge of the area
2.
